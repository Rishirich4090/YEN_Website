- `backend/src/services/certificateService.ts` - PDF certificate generation
- `backend/src/services/emailService.ts` - Email delivery service

### 4. Token Management System ✅
- **Implementation**: Centralized token management utility
- **Features**:
  - Separate file for token storage and retrieval
  - Authentication headers for API requests
  - localStorage integration
  - Token validation and parsing
  - Automatic header injection

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/client/lib/tokenManager.ts` - Complete token management system

### 5. Complete API Validation ✅
- **Implementation**: All backend APIs validated and tested
- **Features**:
  - No "Route not found" errors
  - Proper error handling middleware
  - Health check endpoint
  - CORS configuration
  - 404 handler for invalid routes

**Validation Results**:
```
✅ Health Check: /api/health
✅ Authentication: /api/auth/*
✅ Contact Routes: /api/contact/*
✅ Membership Routes: /api/membership/*
✅ Donation Routes: /api/donations/*
✅ 404 Handling: Proper error responses
```
